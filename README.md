# Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
With little modification, this script can be used to calculate the results of election taking place in your city. All that is needed isa worksheet displaying a voter id in one columns, and their vote in a second column. One modification we could make is to show where the lowest voter trun out was so campaigns can target that area during the next cycle. We could also modify the results to breakdown the candidate results by county to identify any patterns along party lines by district or county.
